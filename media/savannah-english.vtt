00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
People pay a lot of money for home
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.320
security.
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.639
Well, even though my house didn't come
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.519
with home security,
00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:18.160
our house is very secure
00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.600
because we can hear anyone anywhere
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.439
throughout this entire house. Our walls
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.519
are super thin and our floorboards are
00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.080
the squeakiest.
00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.320
So, if you're home alone and you know
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.800
you're home alone,
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.760
then
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.600
if you happen to hear any squeaking at
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.719
all, you better call 911
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.960
because if you can get to them before
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.840
they can get to you,
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.239
then you are safe.
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.800
But if it happens to be grandpa fixing
00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.800
the dryer again and you call 911 on him,
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.480
that's that's going to be pretty awkward
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.480
to explain.
